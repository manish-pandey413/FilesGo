#+title: FilesGo

A command line tool to share files across device, made using [[https://go.dev][Golang]].
It uses [[https://github.com/curl/curl][curl]] to send files with MIME type [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#form-data][multipart/form-data]].
This tool exits because I was too lazy to go get my usb cable. :)

** Requirement
 + [[https://just.systems/][Just]] is optional, but if you want there is a Justfile in case.
 + [[https://go.dev][Go(Golang)]] obv.

** Usage
+ Server side :: i.e the device you want file to be sent.
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/manish-pandey413/FilesGo 
cd FilesGo/
#+end_src
+ Using Just
#+begin_src sh
just run
#+end_src
+ Using normal go commands
#+begin_src sh
cd cmd/FilesGo
go run .
#+end_src

+ Client Side :: Note the ip address that will be displayed after go run/ just run.
#+begin_src sh
curl -v -F --file="@fileYouWantToSend" ipAddress:8080/upload/
#+end_src

Note that @ is important as it represents file is being sent as a binary, and :8080 is port and /upload/ is endpoint.

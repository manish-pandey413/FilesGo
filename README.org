#+title: FilesGo

A command line tool to share files across device, made using [[https://go.dev][Golang]].
It uses [[https://github.com/curl/curl][curl]] to send files with MIME type [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#form-data][multipart/form-data]].
This tool exits because I was too lazy to go get my usb cable. :)
